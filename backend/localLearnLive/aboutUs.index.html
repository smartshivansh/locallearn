      <p class="content">
        Locallearn is a project initiated by DOIONS PVT LTD. It is designed to
        solve the problem of skill training for the learners community
        world-wide.<br />
        At present, Local learn is an AI powered chatbot that provides answers
        to the most commonly asked questions by the learners.<br />
        We believe artificial intelligence can be a game changer when it comes
        to learning and education. Bringing AI in learning doesn’t mean
        replacing teachers and educators with chatbots and virtual assistants.
        We believe AI can fill the gaps that the current learning and education
        system is facing without disturbing the conventional system.
        <br />
        In Spite of numerous policies and reforms in the education system, there
        exists a major problem of insufficient skilled workforce which is a
        challenge to solve. And Locallearn can prove to be an effective solution
        for this problem.
